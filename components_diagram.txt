Components (Core Gameplay & Mechanics):
- Tower Defense Exposure System: The player must defend their “Mind Core” (symbolizing their mental resilience) from waves of phobia-themed enemies—spiders, ghosts, darkness entities, etc.
- Personalized Fear Selection Before gameplay: users select one or more phobias they wish to confront (e.g., spiders, heights, clowns). 
- Exposure Therapy Integration: Each session gradually increases intensity—enemy frequency, realism, and environmental immersion—based on the user’s comfort and progress.
- Defense Towers & Abilities: Players strategically place VR “mental defense towers” such as: Calm Beacons – slow enemy approach Focus Shields – create safe zones Rational Cannons – dispel fear illusions Adaptive Difficulty System Adjusts game intensity based on biometric input (optional smartwatch) or manual user setting. 
- Progress Tracker: Displays player growth and fear desensitization visually, showing resilience gains after each completed session. 
- Safe Mode / Cool-Down: Calming environments (e.g., serene beaches, floating islands) help the user relax after exposure phases. Customizable Fear Worlds Players can edit terrain, lighting, and textures to build their own fear environments for replayability or therapy customization.
